# Root-Finding-Program
Program for Root Finding Problem: As the title suggests, the Root-Finding Problem 
is the problem of finding a root of the equation f(x) = 0, where f(x) is a function of a 
single variable x. Write a program in the Matlab for the following methods to solve 
the problem of numerical approximation, the root-finding problem within 10−5 for the 
given problem. 
 
# Methods: 
(a) Bisection method 
(b) Fixed Point method (use g(x)=f(x)+x) 
(c) Newton’s method 

# Scenario: 
1- Program should ask the user to enter the equation 
2- Program will ask to enter the interval to find root. 
3- Program should ask the user to enter the method to be used 
4- Program should ask the stopping criterion 
5- If stopping criterion is missing, Program should take a by default stopping 
criterion of root-finding within 10−5 for the given problem and should display. 
6- Program will display the roots of the given equation in case the equation has 
a root inside the given interval. In case, there is no root in the given interval 
show a message.
